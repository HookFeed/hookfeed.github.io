&lt;div style="padding: 10px; font-size: 14px;line-height: 20px; background-color: #5A9BCE; border-radius: 2px; color: #fff; margin-bottom: 20px;"&gt;This is a guest post from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/manualwise" style="color: #fff; text-decoration: none" target="_blank"&gt;Manuel Weiss&lt;/a&gt;, Co-Founder and Director of Marketing at &lt;a href="https://www.codeship.io/" style="color: #fff; text-decoration: none" target="_blank"&gt;Codeship&lt;/a&gt;. We are working to bring you valuable, repeatable lessons from the absolute best in the industry. Interested in writing for the HookFeed blog? &lt;a href="mailto:joelle.steiniger@hookfeed.com" style="color: #fff; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold"&gt;Email us!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Codeship we have a simple rule: &lt;i&gt;Everything you think is only an assumption. You need to verify your assumptions by running experiments and delivering evidence.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look at the outcome of our experiments on a weekly basis and keep track of the data. We want to realize quickly if things are working and if not, we are going a different route. The aim is to not run in circle and not wasting any time while at the same time documenting your learnings so the whole team can benefit from them. This is why we’ve developed our very own scientific approach to Marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process ensures we don’t just work on things because we think they work but because they actually do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When building a business you want to make sure you use your time wisely. Using it for things that actually move the needle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important thing when running experiments is the ability to analyze them. Not long ago, this was something that marketers really struggled with. You would have a great idea and use many resources (manpower and money) to make it come to life. But how would you track your target audience’s actions? How would you know how far down the funnel they actually made it? Marketers had to rely on people’s good will to respond to letters or to answer questions truthfully on cold calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, it’s 2014 and we have products like Google Analytics, KISSmetrics, Mixpanel, and Optimizely that enable us to follow a user’s behavior. It’s not about the products though; it’s what they allow us to see. We have the possibility to look at the actions of specific users at any given point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tools guide us in defining funnel stages, setting email automation trigger points, and bringing attention to problems in our product. In the end, they help us create a better product for our users. And from a budget perspective, they also help us Marketers justify our marketing spend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numbers are people and they deserve to be understood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experiments that we run are not intended to immediately generate X% more revenue or bring in Y% more unique visitors. Their main purpose is to help us understand our customers, where they come from, what they struggle with, and what they love!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve found that working with the aforementioned process analyzing our experiments, gaining learnings and consequentially making data-informed decisions gets a lot easier and is actually a lot of fun. As a result, we feel more confident than ever that we are headed in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;So keep this in mind:&lt;/b&gt; You have to make sure that you always &lt;b&gt;analyze and gain learnings&lt;/b&gt; from your experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to learn is by recording estimations prior to launching new campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This forces you to think about the potential outcomes and makes you commit to a goal you sincerely believe you can achieve. Don’t be too hard on yourself in the beginning. Making precise estimations is not easy, but you will improve over-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to give yourself a threshold of how far off you allow yourself to be. If you are &lt;b&gt;way off&lt;/b&gt; you should dig deeper and find out what didn’t go as expected. Let’s look at an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px; font-style: italic; padding: 0 30px;"&gt;You offer a service that offers German-speaking Hamburger cooking classes. Your designer produced beautiful banners and you use some of your budget for paid advertisement. You expect a certain amount of click-throughs and signups. After the experiment, you analyze your numbers and realize that you had the expected amount of unique visitors, but a very bad conversion rate for signups – it is way outside of the threshold you set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px; font-style: italic; padding: 0 30px;"&gt;So you start digging deeper: You quickly discover that the messaging in your banners was all-wrong! English-speaking cooking aficionados, as well as Germans, use the same word for this food: “Hamburgers”. But your landing page is written entirely in German! You paid for all of those clicks and most visitors literally didn’t understand a word you were saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may not have discovered this atrocity had you not analyzed your estimation and set a realistic threshold for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Codeship we have a “game” that makes sure people keep motivated and actually evaluate their actions before we run an experiment. Everybody from the Marketing team has to commit to his/her estimations and when the experiment is finished the person closest to reality receives a special gift from the rest of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s critical that as you conduct experiments, you take note of your estimations, results, and learnings. This way, your teammates (and future you) can learn from it. Information like this is invaluable to new team members as they are able to reconstruct winning formulas and take a historical look at previous activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I have analyzed which countries send us the most organic signups. I look at these organic numbers frequently to recognize trends as early as possible. And, of course, I document them. Now, new team members immediately know why we target certain countries when doing paid activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important that you are tracking everything, the method doesn’t necessarily matter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use spreadsheets (and share an abstracted copy of mine below) but you can conduct these experiments using whatever tools you’re most comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Firstly,&lt;/b&gt; it is important to define the channels you’ll be working with. For example: Blog, Newsletter, Podcast Sponsorship, LinkedIn, …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Secondly,&lt;/b&gt; you need to make sure you have the most important stages of your funnel represented and tracked. If you are a SaaS product like Codeship you most likely will have something like Unique Visitors, Signups, Activated Users, and Paid Customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thirdly,&lt;/b&gt; get the numbers for a certain period of time for these stages of your funnel. I like to look at them in a month-by-month basis because with a lot of activities (especially paid) it’s easier to map expenses and outcome together this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the previously mentioned products, all it takes is the correct setup (ask your developers to help you) and some time to create a structure that might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;August – Twitter:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;2,087 Unique Visitors, 120 Signups, 50 Activated Users, 4 Customers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;September – Twitter:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;2,140 Unique Visitors, 125 Signups, 52 Activated Users, 4 Customers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have these metrics, you can calculate Conversion Rates. 125 Signups / 2,140 Unique Visitors, for example, gives you a Conversion Rate of 5.84%. Do the same thing for the remaining stages of your funnel. Look at them for at least throughout the last 6 months and for your most important channels. This is where your main learnings will come from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/a/railsonfire.com/spreadsheets/d/1auC2dAKxB71_lPjTNPi3S81Nanfmh2bB5prz5dBIJdA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"&gt;I set up a quick spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; that shows channels in a month-by-month comparison and calculates Conversion Rates for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it great? The numbers (people!) are telling you what to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have a great Conversion Rate from Unique Visitors to Signups via LinkedIn,
but very few Unique Visitors in comparison to other channels? Put your efforts into getting more visitors from LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a huge drop-off in Conversion Rate from Signups to Activated Users from people coming via Google? This could indicate that your onboarding process is creating problems. Do you see bad Conversion Rates from Unique Visitors to Signups? Hit up some A/B tests for your Landing Page!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Actionable Tasks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you’re tracking your channels month-by-month, it’s easy to calculate their average performance. If we are defining a new experiment, we now have data to base our estimations upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you want to increase the Signup rate for one of your Landing Pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How about this experiment:&lt;/b&gt; Start putting Twitter testimonials on the Landing Page to provide social proof. Our assumption is that this should help create trust. And more trust should lead to more Signups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously this Landing Page got 1,000 Unique Visitors and 70 Signups per month giving you a Conversion Rate of 7%. The amount of people hitting your Landing Page won’t change that much by running this experiment. But your Signup rate should increase. Looking at your data, you can base your estimation on an average of 7% and commit to a predicted rise in Conversion Rate by 2.5% giving you 95 Signups next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did this experiment work? Did it increase your Conversion Rate to Signups? Document it for your team and &lt;b&gt;define actionable tasks&lt;/b&gt;. In this case: From now on every Landing Page will show Twitter testimonials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are living in exciting times in which you can visualize the depths of your funnels and track customers on their journey from 1st visit towards loyal, long-term customer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s on you to use it to your advantage and gain learnings from the tools available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, you need a process in-place. This article describes parts of how my team at Codeship works on this. But your team may approach it differently. Just make sure you don’t stop at making assumptions. Always try to get learnings from what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at numbers to help you make decisions is great but make sure you don’t get caught in the trap of only executing. Always re-evaluate your channels and their performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least: &lt;b&gt;Don’t blindly follow your numbers.&lt;/b&gt; There will be times when you have to trust your gut-feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&amp;ldquo;If Only We Had __________.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The deliberation and blame in the minds of SaaS founders — and how you can overcome it.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is tough as a small bootstrapped team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re constantly playing the role of underdog, with few wins, little appreciation, and constant doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is never enough time, money, or energy to achieve what you want in the timeframe you want it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you start to look elsewhere. You subconsciously place blame on current teammates, events, etc. (or even the lack of future things).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If only we had one more developer&lt;/strong&gt;, we’d be able to get to product-market fit faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If only we had a bit of funding&lt;/strong&gt;, we could afford to try advertising and find our flywheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If only we had more time to focus on marketing&lt;/strong&gt;, we could drive more consistent traffic and get more signups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I constantly find myself thinking in terms of, &amp;ldquo;If only we had ______&amp;rdquo; and I’ve been trying my best to stop this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is that you can do all of these things, even with strapped resources, as long as you’re ok with it taking a bit longer. &lt;strong&gt;Which isn’t so bad.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Take your time. Love your product. Love your customers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheBerg"&gt;Jeff Berg&lt;/a&gt;, Owner of &lt;a href="http://get.planningcenteronline.com/"&gt;Planning Center Online&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Avoiding the Rabbit Hole&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing you can do, is detect when you&amp;rsquo;re thinking this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anxiety and fear of moving too slow seem to be triggers for placing blame on external factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re experiencing these feelings, do a double-take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question your thoughts, and challenge yourself to prove their validity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting Deliberate Roles and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One response I&amp;rsquo;ve found to be successful, is to be deliberate about the roles and goals of teammates. This probably sounds super obvious &amp;ndash; but as you know, founders have an immense range of tasks on their plates, and I know I need constant reminders to be deliberate about various aspects of my day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s so easy to place tasks on auto-pilot as they become familiar, but that is one way quality decreases over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, by not being deliberate and clear about who should be working on what, and exactly what they should be delivering when, you are leaving the door open to be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the worst aspects of your culture can be growing disappointment and resentment amongst teammates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond setting goals for your team, you need to set goals for your product and customers. &lt;strong&gt;This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you should open up Excel and spend hours creating a 5-year MRR &amp;ldquo;forecast.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; Although that&amp;rsquo;s always fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, you should look at the work you&amp;rsquo;re doing on your product, and how you&amp;rsquo;re trying to help your customers be more successful&amp;hellip;and set measurable goals to track progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So take a day, grab a pen, and do some planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work with your team to make sure everyone is on the same page, and that you&amp;rsquo;re working in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The milestones you decide on may not come as quick as you like, but that&amp;rsquo;s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a one-time thing. Planning should be a regular part of your flow, and an easy fallback whenever you start feeling anxious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Do You Actually Need Help?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage, you should have a good idea of whether your internal frustrations are justified, and whether you actually need help&amp;hellip;whether that&amp;rsquo;s in the form of hiring someone else, raising some funding, or another form of outside assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on your deliberate planning, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a roadmap that either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calms you and puts things in perspective, or:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helps you be objective about what&amp;rsquo;s actually needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case that you do need outside help, consider how you could re-arrange your roadmap to shift revenue-building activities sooner. Can you find a way to continue self-funding and grow faster by making sacrifices in less-important areas of your business or product?&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Unfounded Founder Fears&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;And Why You Have To Get Past Them&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I laid awake almost every night that week playing mental ping pong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was convinced we weren’t ready yet, though all “expert” advice would preach otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Launch early! Launch Often! Iterate!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Reid Hoffman Quote" src="https://d2uerwjzv5u4r9.cloudfront.net/tumblr_l63ltpE9ZZ1qz6pqio1_500.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Screw that. HookFeed was my baby. And my baby wasn’t ready to meet the world yet. Was it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emotional impact of doubt had taken a big toll on Matt and I. We’d battle back and forth. We’d convince each other of reasons to launch, then find all kinds of reasons to wait. We were at the tail-end of a many-month long dev hole, with little to no outside feedback. We were exhausted. And we hadn’t even “started” yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were doing everything we’d advise others not to do. And we knew it, but we couldn’t stop. Until one day, when we explained it all to our buddy, Ross Campbell. He patiently listened, smiling the whole while. Finally, when we’d done our best to convince him why we weren’t ready to launch yet he just started laughing. “You guys have no idea the value you’ve already created!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damn, he was right. We were so close to our long-term vision of HookFeed that we didn’t even see how valuable we’d already made it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conversation prompted us to do what we should have done weeks earlier. We talked about our fears. About what was really holding us back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny thing about a simple exercise like that is when you say your fears out loud, the things that have been keeping you up at night sound totally small. And often, counter-intuitive from what you know to be true. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason this works so well is because fear is (usually) irrational. So verbalizing out loud what you’re actually worried about forces you to acknowledge that, and think rationally about it. I highly encourage you try this whenever you’re feeling doubtful about something. It’s so simple and so effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Here’s an example of a real fear I had:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if we drive a ton of launch traffic, all those people look once, don’t see “X” feature, and never come back.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Truth:&lt;/strong&gt; It takes an average of 6-8 touch points with someone before they ultimately buy. Maybe more depending on what you’re selling. As entrepreneurs, we know this — which is why we put so much effort into things like building email lists, blogging, educating, etc. We know we need to provide value, earn trust, and build loyal audiences before those people are going to be willing to enter their credit card numbers. So the logical thing to do would be to get that process in motion sooner, rather than later — all the while, iterating on the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing about all our other fears is that they really came down to one common thread: Fear of the unknown. And there were a lot of unknowns about launching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if no one signs up?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if everyone expects “X” feature and we don’t have it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if our pricing is too high (or too low)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have written pages of “what ifs”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the thing about these kinds of questions is, there’s only one way to find out the answer. You have to take the unknown, and make it known. &lt;strong&gt;You have to launch.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the emotional relief of moving past whatever fears have paralyzed you in pre-launch purgatory, there are other intrinsic benefits to launching your product that you simply can’t take advantage of until you release it out into the wild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Until You Launch, You’re Guessing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every feature, every decision is a guess. You make a lot of upfront assumptions when you’re launching a product, and only when you launch are you able to prove those assumptions right or wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s a real example.&lt;/strong&gt;
When we decided to launch we were missing what I considered to be 50% of the product. We were offering “customer analytics for Stripe”, but only supporting companies who operate on subscription billing. This left out anyone doing one-off charges (like all eCommerce companies). In other words, were only serving a segment of our entire potential market. So the question became:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we serve 0% of the market until we can serve 100%?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, do we start with what we’ve got (subscription services) and grow from there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We opted for the latter and something awesome happened. We received a number of signups from eCommerce companies anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It gave us a chance to talk to them personally, get them excited about what was to come for their specific needs, and develop an arsenal of excited, qualified, prospective customers. Plus, we require a credit card up front, so we knew these people were serious about wanting to try (and pay for) our product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can place an actual dollar value on building out that portion of the product. No assumptions. No guessing. The demand is loud and clear, and there’s money on the line. Perhaps most importantly, we know what to prioritize — which is huge when you’ve got a small team with limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A side note to mention about this is that people are much more patient than we often give them credit for. Not a single person was upset that they had to wait a few weeks — rather they were excited that we were addressing their needs and felt more connected to us and our process after talking to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Launching Allows You to be Deliberate in Future Decisions.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you launch and open up the feedback loop with real customers (and real potential customers) you get a much clearer understanding of what’s most important. That doesn’t mean building every feature they request (and they’ll request a lot) — but rather, you’ll realize that some of the things you thought would be “must haves” haven’t been requested by a single person. Or 80% of people are all telling you the exact same thing. Feedback like this is invaluable to your prioritization process and development of your roadmap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every decision you make has a long-term impact on your product. You’ve got to be deliberate about even the smallest decisions, features, etc. Bottom line: the more informed you are, the less guessing you have to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, you just need to be realistic and honest with yourself. Step back look objectively at what you’ve already built. Consult a trusted friend. Consult 10 if you&amp;rsquo;re still unsure. Don’t worry about perfection, long-term visions, or anything else holding you back. It’s all going to change anyway. If you’re solving the core problem you set out to solve, and you’re holding back for no good reason, do yourself a huge favor&amp;hellip;launch already!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Or, The Difference Between a Business and a Startup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a business degree. I do have entrepreneurial parents. My father has a commercial real estate development company with a number of employees. My mother is a Dietician running a solo private practice. Their businesses are completely different in almost every way, except for one: profitability is the main goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what I grew up knowing about business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://howtobuildarocketship.com/podcast/ep-27-jason-cohen/"&gt;recent interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/asmartbear"&gt;Jason Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, Founder of &lt;a href="http://wpengine.com"&gt;WP Engine&lt;/a&gt;, we got to talking about business goals. He said something that, at the time, seemed jarring to me, though I’ve since come to understand his point. He said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Profitability is the last thing you want. Profitability indicates you’re out of ideas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What he means is:&lt;/strong&gt; If you had ideas of how to continue to grow, you’d invest back into the company to pursue those avenues, and grow until the seams burst (or you IPO ☺). Then you grow some more. You wouldn’t kick back in your Herman Miller chair and brag to your investors about the massive profits you’re piling up (you’d probably scare the crap out of them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason Cohen is running a startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So what’s the difference between a Business and a Startup?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trick question - they’re both businesses. The difference is their objectives. And the difference in objectives means big differences in how they operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Businesses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are, in fact, driven by profitability and stable long-term value. Sure, you’ll invest some portion of profits back into the company to continue to grow at a stable rate, but profitability is still your north star. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Startups&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on the other hand, are focused on top-end revenue, but most importantly, &lt;strong&gt;growth potential&lt;/strong&gt;. Growth trumps profitability, which is why most VC backed startups are operating at seemingly huge losses. It’s an investment in &lt;em&gt;growth potential&lt;/em&gt;, and this is a very different kind of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which one is better? That’s like asking if chocolate or vanilla is better. It all depends on what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steve Blank shares his fantastic perspective in this short 2 minute video:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/CIA9ikESXYI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess the reason Jason’s comment took me a little while to process is because it went against everything I knew (at that point in time) about running a business. (I still have a lot to learn).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Profitability has always been my bottom-line goal (and still is) for my product &lt;a href="http://hookfeed.com"&gt;HookFeed&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, if you ask me to describe what I do, the word ‘startup’ is one of the first words out of my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is HookFeed? Is it a startup, or a business? Or, rather, a better question might be: what do I want it to be? Because the answer to that would (and should) drastically change the things I work on (and towards) today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in a similar boat, trying to figure out what you are or what you want to be, I’ll leave you with this: there’s a reason the rate of failure for startups is so high. It’s the same reason the payoff for success is also high. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a risk : reward ratio.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while figuring out your risk tolerance is important, and will certainly help guide you in the right direction in a practical sense, it should only be a piece of your evaluation. Ultimately, it comes down to asking yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; idea of success? What will make &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; happy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you can answer that, you’ll know what to work on today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, I can’t help but think of myself at the frozen yogurt shop faced with the cliché choice of chocolate or vanilla. I’m a swirl kinda girl&amp;hellip;maybe that’s a sign?&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Blow Your Opportunity to Squash Customer Objections&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was 18 and on my way downtown to start my first company.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many aspects were uncertain, but one thing was for sure: the name had to sound legit. If I wanted my company to be successful like the ones on TV, people would need to think it was huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So naturally, I took my initials, added some awesome, and ended up with &lt;strong&gt;MHG Enterprises&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did everything right. I started with business cards, a fancy title, a &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; phone number &lt;em&gt;(my parent&amp;rsquo;s home phone)&lt;/em&gt;, address labels, printed envelopes&amp;hellip;the whole shebang!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Except I did everything wrong.&lt;/strong&gt; People love working with small companies&amp;hellip;as long as they have strong faith that you&amp;rsquo;re capable of delivering on your promises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve drifted towards the other end of the spectrum naming my current company &lt;a href="http://smallhq.com?utm_source=hookfeed_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dont-act-big-dont-act-small"&gt;Small HQ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that we are small &lt;em&gt;(just &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SDMattG"&gt;me&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoelleSteiniger"&gt;Joelle&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;, and that we want to stay small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until recently that we realized the negative effects this was having on our product, &lt;a href="http://hookfeed.com?utm_source=hookfeed_blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dont-act-big-dont-act-small"&gt;HookFeed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without even thinking twice about it, we took the pride of being small and injected it directly into HookFeed&amp;rsquo;s sign up page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/smallhq/old-vs-new-signup.gif" alt="Old vs. New HookFeed sign up Pages" class="full-image"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Old Page&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wasn&amp;rsquo;t our first rodeo - we&amp;rsquo;d been building and supporting products for about a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One realization we&amp;rsquo;d made was that a personal touch could go a long way. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the (many) reasons why we use &lt;a href="https://www.intercom.io/"&gt;Intercom&lt;/a&gt; to communicate with our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love when, as the customer of another product, the founder reaches out to help me. It shows that they are small enough to be the sort of company I&amp;rsquo;d like to work with, and serious enough that the founder sees the value in going the extra mile for customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Joelle and I let this personalization go a bit too far when designing our page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;HookFeed is 100% founder-funded and made with love in sunny San Diego&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Mostly selfish reasons. What does our funding or location have to do with what our potential customers are thinking when they sign up? &lt;strong&gt;Not-a-damn-thing!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention the form was so tall that it pushed the section off the page for most visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The New Page&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After taking a second look many weeks later &lt;em&gt;(with a clear mind)&lt;/em&gt;, we decided to remove the section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It made us seem like too small of a team to take seriously, and didn&amp;rsquo;t accomplish the original goal: showing that we&amp;rsquo;re here, and ready to hustle for whatever you need as our customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A Personal Touch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to keep a personal photo of one of us, and offer to help with any questions they may have. We really are just an email away, and that sets us apart from a large, faceless company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Joelle Offering Help to New Customers" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/smallhq/joelle-help-box.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new help box is featured prominently, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t give the impression that the company is tiny, unlike the first version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Objection Squashing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re a small team running a big product&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get a page to &amp;ldquo;Done&amp;rdquo; and then move on to more important matters for weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of our sign up page, we launched with two objection-squashing Q&amp;amp;As right next to the credit card form (inspired by &lt;a href="https://secure.letsfreckle.com/signup/Small"&gt;Freckle&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; sign up page).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of launch, we didn&amp;rsquo;t have a free plan, so the Q&amp;amp;As were focused on the concerns of paying users. In the rush to update our pricing structure&amp;hellip;we forgot to update our sign up page with more appropriate objection-busters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that if I were signing up for a free plan, I would not expect to need to give a credit card!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the subtle changes we made to these Q&amp;amp;As that now adapt based on the plan you select on the previous page. If you&amp;rsquo;re a free user, we address entirely different concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Addressing HookFeed Customer Objections" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/smallhq/old-vs-new-objections.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Will I be charged [now vs. anything]?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;rsquo;m signing up to become a free user of a product, and I see &amp;ldquo;Will I be charged now?&amp;rdquo; in the FAQs&amp;hellip;it leads me to believe that at some point in the future, I will be charged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas if I&amp;rsquo;m signing up for a paid plan with a trial, my main concern is that I won&amp;rsquo;t be charged until my trial has completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also clarify that if you ever do need to upgrade, we will give you advance notice before making any changes to your account that will trigger a charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why do you need my card?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the first question, if our explanation of why we need your credit card includes language about your trial expiring, then it&amp;rsquo;s natural to assume that something will change at that point in time for your account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Free trial?! I thought I was signing up for a free plan!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why we changed the language for free users to not mention a trial in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For paid customers, we focus on keeping your account functional rather than emphasizing &amp;ldquo;back-and-forth&amp;rdquo; hassle when your trial ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Can You Do to Avoid the Same Mistakes?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every new feature or change in direction requires that you revisit old pages, copy, and positioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; with SaaS products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you grow, this laundry list of product aspects to monitor and keep up-to-date grows so do your best to limit your early scope to the bare minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Constantly revisit the flows that your customers experience. When each member of your team goes heads-down on improving parts of your product, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to neglect the experience as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Get Out of Denial About Your Startup’s Priorities&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;With One, Simple Question.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As startup founders, we’re all looking for ways to move that needle. But when was the last time you stopped to question your efforts and whether or not they’re the ‘right ones’? I can say I did this zero times&amp;hellip;until a few weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent chat with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hnshah"&gt;Hiten Shah&lt;/a&gt;, he told me that the thing he sees early startups struggle with the most, time and time again, is misplaced focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t the answer I was expecting. Or maybe I should say, it wasn’t the answer I was hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted a concrete, common reason like, “Most early startups focus too much on customer development, marketing, product features, scaling, etc&amp;hellip;when they should be doing [BLANK].” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Misplaced focus,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he hit the nail on the head. So why was that such an unsatisfying answer? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I wanted that magic bullet! Do x instead of y. Boom. No matter what size, shape, stage, or market — just do x! Instead of being handed a cure-all, &lt;strong&gt;I was forced to face something I’d long been putting off&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the right focus and the right set of tasks is something I’ve been personally struggling with on &lt;a href="http://www.hookfeed.com?utm_source=hookfeed-blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=get-out-of-denial"&gt;HookFeed&lt;/a&gt; for the past few months without admitting it. I was guilty. And now I was forced to look at the problem head-on, and figure out what the hell to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Denial is a Sneaky Thing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s funny how we are able to slip into denial about all kinds of things in life without even realizing it’s happening. We humans are very good at deceiving ourselves. As &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/03/denial-science-chris-mooney"&gt;Chris Mooney&lt;/a&gt; puts it, &lt;em&gt;“when we think we’re reasoning, we’re often rationalizing.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the underlying reason for denial (self-preservation, pride, laziness, fear, etc.) we’re so damn good at it that we usually don’t even realize we’re doing it. We trick ourselves into some false reality without trying to do so. It’s actually amazing! But it’s dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about denial is, it never works long-term. Reality bats last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Let me give you an example:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I was busy all day — so I’m making progress towards my goal.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know this is bullshit. But I’d be willing to bet you’re guilty of this mentality. We justify this to ourselves all the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This false reality that busy = productive is dangerous. The &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; reality is that it doesn’t matter how busy you are if you’re not actually accomplishing your goal. If you can reach your goal with almost no effort, great! It really has little to do with how hard you work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting in more hours is not a badge of honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, it’s quite the opposite. I’d love be able to put less in and get more out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are always going to be plenty of outside factors that make it difficult to reach your goals — but do you ever stop to ask yourself if the things within your control, the things you are doing are the right things for that exact point in time? I rarely did&amp;hellip;until recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Confession: I don’t know what the hell I’m doing.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re in a phase with &lt;a href="http://www.hookfeed.com?utm_source=hookfeed-blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=get-out-of-denial"&gt;HookFeed&lt;/a&gt;, that we’ve never been in before. We’re past all the super early half-baked versions. We’ve got a clear roadmap. The product is incredibly valuable (in my humble opinion ☺). It’s time to sell subscriptions. &lt;strong&gt;It’s time to grow!&lt;/strong&gt; And I’m responsible for moving the needle — which is a new, scary frontier for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve written before about how when too many choices are in front of you, analysis paralysis sets in. But, what about when the choices themselves are unclear?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m faced with challenges that are so new I don’t even know where to start. So I don’t. I work on all of the things I know how to do, whether or not they’re the things that will get that needle to move. I do the things I know I’m good at. I stay plenty busy. And the needle doesn’t move. This, my friends, is denial. And it’s a recipe for failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So How’s That Working for You?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t help but think back to an instructor I once had. Big, booming, Belgian guy with a killer accent. He’d ask this one question that just came back to me as I sit here writing this post. You’d tell him about your struggles in achieving some goal (getting your team to work better together, getting a promotion at work, losing weight&amp;hellip;whatever). You’d list off the things you’d been doing to try and achieve it. And after each action you listed, he’d ask:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“And how’s that working for you?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’d list off something else you did and he’d ask again. &lt;em&gt;“And how’s that working for you?”&lt;/em&gt; He did this incessantly&amp;hellip;often to the point of berating the person. But his point was clear every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you keep doing things that aren’t working, you’ll never get there. Try something else. If that doesn’t work, try something else. Get creative. Problem solve. Attack things from different angles. But stop spending your energy doing things you know don’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persistence does not equal progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing about running a startup is that there’s never a clear-cut path. I know we’re going to make lots of mistakes. It’s part of the fun and a component of a unique, lifelong education. In fact, the freedom to make them is part of why I got into this business instead of something easier or more secure. But in order to grow (not just move the needle, but grow personally) I’m going to need to get comfortable being uncomfortable. I’m going to have to experiment, try new things — fail fast and move on. I need to avoid the opportunity for denial and take that instructor’s advice to be more mindful about what I’m doing, and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why at the end of every day I now spend a few minutes (that’s all it takes) to think about what I did and ask myself &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“how’s this working for me?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;How to Boost SaaS Cash Flow by Exploiting December&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;December can be a fickle month for sales in the SaaS biz. But we think we’ve discovered a way to squeeze the most juice out of the lemon and turn December into a powerhouse month for cash flow by taking advantage of one simple reality:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Year-End Budget Surpluses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I dive into our tactics, let me back up to the origins of this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Spring, I flew to Vegas for a little SaaS conference. It ended up being my best business decision all year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hesitate to tell you which conference, because I worry that if more people catch on&amp;hellip;prices will increase and attendance will become even more limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah hell, it was &lt;a href="http://www.microconf.com/"&gt;MicroConf&lt;/a&gt; !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within minutes of the first talk by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/asmartbear"&gt;Jason Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, I was writing frantically jotting down notes about what’s worked for his company, &lt;a href="http://wpengine.com/"&gt;WP Engine&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the strategies were simple, and seemed obvious in hindsight, but they had significant impacts on the cash flow of his company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gist was this: by pushing monthly-paying customers towards annual plans, cash flow would increase to the extent that their marketing budget was covered. They were essentially raising investment from their current customers who trusted them most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, we’ve struggled with &lt;a href="http://www.hookfeed.com"&gt;HookFeed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.minimalytics.com"&gt;Minimalytics&lt;/a&gt; to find opportunities to increase cash flow via an annual plan option. It can be difficult when your product is brand new, or when you know you haven’t found product-market fit quite yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At MicroConf, Jason detailed a few strategies that they use to increase cash flow. One of them really stood out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They send an email a few months after sign up, re-iterating the discount for paying annually. &lt;a href="http://moz.com/rand/"&gt;Rand Fishkin&lt;/a&gt; wrote a bit about this email &lt;a href="http://moz.com/rand/exceptional-upgrade-path-ux-from-wpengine/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason isn&amp;rsquo;t the only one doing this sort of marketing. Just the other day, I received this email from &lt;a href="https://www.codeship.io/"&gt;CodeShip&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="CodeShip Annual Upgrade Email" src="https://d2uerwjzv5u4r9.cloudfront.net/codeship-annual-email.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this morning, I received the following well-timed email from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brennandunn"&gt;Brennan Dunn&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Quick — what&amp;rsquo;s tax deductible for 2013 and has helped over 5,000 freelancers get more clients and make more money? If you guessed my books, you&amp;rsquo;re right :-) Today, and just today, I&amp;rsquo;m putting both on sale for the next few hours [&amp;hellip;]&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can tell you that as soon as I read these emails, the gears were turning in my head calculating how much I’d save&amp;hellip;thinking it’s a no-brainer to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we weren’t currently running leaner than normal, we absolutely would have upgraded our CodeShip account. And now that I know it’s an option, I’ll probably upgrade to annual billing in the future once our own SaaS revenues increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you show happy customers pricing options, they no longer need to choose whether or not to buy&amp;hellip;they need to choose how much to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these strategies are great — especially when you’re targeting existing customers. But we just launched &lt;a href="http://www.hookfeed.com"&gt;HookFeed&lt;/a&gt; last week. If we’re waiting a few months to send an upgrade promotion email, or triggering it based on heavy usage, people won’t be seeing those promotions for some time. And we’ll have to wait even longer to see a bump in our cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we asked ourselves, &amp;ldquo;What can we do upon launch, in a tough month, to entice annual plan signups?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using Timing to Increase Your SaaS Cash Flow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many businesses, December is a month of blowing budgets. Many companies have budget surpluses heading into the end of the year and are much looser with how they spend funds than they are in surrounding months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, employees are often encouraged to spend any remaining budget they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but that sounds like a gold mine to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached out to some friends to ask about their experience with budget surpluses, and learned a bit about budgets in large companies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In fact employees are often encouraged to spend any remaining budget they have. In contrast to startups; big business department annual budgets can put departments in a &amp;lsquo;use it or lose it&amp;rsquo; scenario. Where annual budgets may not roll over to the next year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And about the tax benefits of making certain purchases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Businesses are incentived to spend year end budgets because these purchases are at a &amp;lsquo;pre-tax&amp;rsquo; discount of up to 39%.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Implementing Annual Discounts in Our Product&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how we approached this with &lt;a href="http://www.hookfeed.com"&gt;HookFeed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We modified our homepage design before launch, in order to push the annual plan harder than previously planned. After a few iterations, we decided the following aspects were important:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promotion text in the pricing section speaking directly to any visitors who may be looking to spend their remaining budgets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make it clear that the promotion is only available through the end of the year — adding some urgency (we’re offering 3 months free versus the regular 2 months free when paying annually).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decided to still default to monthly prices so as not to give sticker shock to those who want to choose monthly billing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added a checkbox saying &amp;ldquo;I want three months free&amp;rdquo; which toggles the price to the annual plan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hookfeed.com"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is what we ended up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="HookFeed's Approach to Annual Pricing Discounts #1" src="https://d2uerwjzv5u4r9.cloudfront.net/hookfeed-annual-pricing-header.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="HookFeed's Approach to Annual Pricing Discounts #2" src="https://d2uerwjzv5u4r9.cloudfront.net/hookfeed-annual-pricing.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an early-stage, bootstrapped SaaS, cash flow is a top priority. If you’re in a similar boat, it should be your priority as well. It is the one metric that decides whether we’ll still be working on our products in X months and not looking for jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I can combine a small tweak with good timing to yield a cash-flow surge, you bet your ass I’m gonna try!&lt;/p&gt;
