&lt;h1&gt;Get Out of Denial About Your Startup’s Priorities&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;With One, Simple Question.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As startup founders, we’re all looking for ways to move that needle. But when was the last time you stopped to question your efforts and whether or not they’re the ‘right ones’? I can say I did this zero times…until a few weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent chat with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hnshah"&gt;Hiten Shah&lt;/a&gt;, he told me that the thing he sees early startups struggle with the most, time and time again, is misplaced focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t the answer I was expecting. Or maybe I should say, it wasn’t the answer I was hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted a concrete, common reason like, “Most early startups focus too much on customer development, marketing, product features, scaling, etc… when they should be doing [BLANK].” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Misplaced focus,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he hit the nail on the head. So why was that such an unsatisfying answer? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I wanted that magic bullet! Do x instead of y. Boom. No matter what size, shape, stage, or market — just do x! Instead of being handed a cure-all, &lt;strong&gt;I was forced to face something I’d long been putting off&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the right focus and the right set of tasks is something I’ve been personally struggling with on &lt;a href="http://www.hookfeed.com?utm_source=hookfeed-blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=get-out-of-denial"&gt;HookFeed&lt;/a&gt; for the past few months without admitting it. I was guilty. And now I was forced to look at the problem head-on, and figure out what the hell to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Denial is a Sneaky Thing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s funny how we are able to slip into denial about all kinds of things in life without even realizing it’s happening. We humans are very good at deceiving ourselves. As &lt;a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/03/denial-science-chris-mooney"&gt;Chris Mooney&lt;/a&gt; puts it, &lt;em&gt;“when we think we’re reasoning, we’re often rationalizing.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the underlying reason for denial (self-preservation, pride, laziness, fear, etc.) we’re so damn good at it that we usually don’t even realize we’re doing it. We trick ourselves into some false reality without trying to do so. It’s actually amazing! But it’s dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing about denial is, it never works long-term. Reality bats last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Let me give you an example:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I was busy all day — so I’m making progress towards my goal.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know this is bullshit. But I’d be willing to bet you’re guilty of this mentality. We justify this to ourselves all the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This false reality that busy = productive is dangerous. The &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; reality is that it doesn’t matter how busy you are if you’re not actually accomplishing your goal. If you can reach your goal with almost no effort, great! It really has little to do with how hard you work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting in more hours is not a badge of honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, it’s quite the opposite. I’d love be able to put less in and get more out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are always going to be plenty of outside factors that make it difficult to reach your goals — but do you ever stop to ask yourself if the things within your control, the things you are doing are the right things for that exact point in time? I rarely did… until recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Confession: I don’t know what the hell I’m doing.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re in a phase with &lt;a href="http://www.hookfeed.com?utm_source=hookfeed-blog&amp;amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;amp;utm_campaign=get-out-of-denial"&gt;HookFeed&lt;/a&gt;, that we’ve never been in before. We’re past all the super early half-baked versions. We’ve got a clear roadmap. The product is incredibly valuable (in my humble opinion ☺). It’s time to sell subscriptions. &lt;strong&gt;It’s time to grow!&lt;/strong&gt; And I’m responsible for moving the needle — which is a new, scary frontier for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve written before about how when too many choices are in front of you, analysis paralysis sets in. But, what about when the choices themselves are unclear?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m faced with challenges that are so new I don’t even know where to start. So I don’t. I work on all of the things I know how to do, whether or not they’re the things that will get that needle to move. I do the things I know I’m good at. I stay plenty busy. And the needle doesn’t move. This, my friends, is denial. And it’s a recipe for failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;So How’s That Working for You?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t help but think back to an instructor I once had. Big, booming, Belgian guy with a killer accent. He’d ask this one question that just came back to me as I sit here writing this post. You’d tell him about your struggles in achieving some goal (getting your team to work better together, getting a promotion at work, losing weight… whatever). You’d list off the things you’d been doing to try and achieve it. And after each action you listed, he’d ask:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“And how’s that working for you?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’d list off something else you did and he’d ask again. &lt;em&gt;“And how’s that working for you?”&lt;/em&gt; He did this incessantly… often to the point of berating the person. But his point was clear every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you keep doing things that aren’t working, you’ll never get there. Try something else. If that doesn’t work, try something else. Get creative. Problem solve. Attack things from different angles. But stop spending your energy doing things you know don’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persistence does not equal progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing about running a startup is that there’s never a clear-cut path. I know we’re going to make lots of mistakes. It’s part of the fun and a component of a unique, lifelong education. In fact, the freedom to make them is part of why I got into this business instead of something easier or more secure. But in order to grow (not just move the needle, but grow personally) I’m going to need to get comfortable being uncomfortable. I’m going to have to experiment, try new things — fail fast and move on. I need to avoid the opportunity for denial and take that instructor’s advice to be more mindful about what I’m doing, and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why at the end of every day I now spend a few minutes (that’s all it takes) to think about what I did and ask myself &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“how’s this working for me?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;How to Boost SaaS Cash Flow by Exploiting December&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;December can be a fickle month for sales in the SaaS biz. But we think we’ve discovered a way to squeeze the most juice out of the lemon and turn December into a powerhouse month for cash flow by taking advantage of one simple reality:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Year-End Budget Surpluses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I dive into our tactics, let me back up to the origins of this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Spring, I flew to Vegas for a little SaaS conference. It ended up being my best business decision all year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hesitate to tell you which conference, because I worry that if more people catch on…prices will increase and attendance will become even more limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah hell, it was &lt;a href="http://www.microconf.com/"&gt;MicroConf&lt;/a&gt; !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within minutes of the first talk by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/asmartbear"&gt;Jason Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, I was writing frantically jotting down notes about what’s worked for his company, &lt;a href="http://wpengine.com/"&gt;WP Engine&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the strategies were simple, and seemed obvious in hindsight, but they had significant impacts on the cash flow of his company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gist was this: by pushing monthly-paying customers towards annual plans, cash flow would increase to the extent that their marketing budget was covered. They were essentially raising investment from their current customers who trusted them most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, we’ve struggled with &lt;a href="http://www.hookfeed.com"&gt;HookFeed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.minimalytics.com"&gt;Minimalytics&lt;/a&gt; to find opportunities to increase cash flow via an annual plan option. It can be difficult when your product is brand new, or when you know you haven’t found product-market fit quite yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At MicroConf, Jason detailed a few strategies that they use to increase cash flow. One of them really stood out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They send an email a few months after sign up, re-iterating the discount for paying annually. &lt;a href="http://moz.com/rand/"&gt;Rand Fishkin&lt;/a&gt; wrote a bit about this email &lt;a href="http://moz.com/rand/exceptional-upgrade-path-ux-from-wpengine/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason isn&amp;rsquo;t the only one doing this sort of marketing. Just the other day, I received this email from &lt;a href="https://www.codeship.io/"&gt;CodeShip&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="CodeShip Annual Upgrade Email" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/HookFeed/codeship-annual-email.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this morning, I received the following well-timed email from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brennandunn"&gt;Brennan Dunn&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Quick — what&amp;rsquo;s tax deductible for 2013 and has helped over 5,000 freelancers get more clients and make more money? If you guessed my books, you&amp;rsquo;re right :-) Today, and just today, I&amp;rsquo;m putting both on sale for the next few hours [&amp;hellip;]&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can tell you that as soon as I read these emails, the gears were turning in my head calculating how much I’d save&amp;hellip;thinking it’s a no-brainer to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we weren’t currently running leaner than normal, we absolutely would have upgraded our CodeShip account. And now that I know it’s an option, I’ll probably upgrade to annual billing in the future once our own SaaS revenues increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you show happy customers pricing options, they no longer need to choose whether or not to buy&amp;hellip;they need to choose how much to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these strategies are great — especially when you’re targeting existing customers. But we just launched &lt;a href="http://www.hookfeed.com"&gt;HookFeed&lt;/a&gt; last week. If we’re waiting a few months to send an upgrade promotion email, or triggering it based on heavy usage, people won’t be seeing those promotions for some time. And we’ll have to wait even longer to see a bump in our cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we asked ourselves, &amp;ldquo;What can we do upon launch, in a tough month, to entice annual plan signups?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Using Timing to Increase Your SaaS Cash Flow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many businesses, December is a month of blowing budgets. Many companies have budget surpluses heading into the end of the year and are much looser with how they spend funds than they are in surrounding months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, employees are often encouraged to spend any remaining budget they can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but that sounds like a gold mine to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached out to some friends to ask about their experience with budget surpluses, and learned a bit about budgets in large companies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;In fact employees are often encouraged to spend any remaining budget they have. In contrast to startups; big business department annual budgets can put departments in a &amp;lsquo;use it or lose it&amp;rsquo; scenario. Where annual budgets may not roll over to the next year.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kevinsmoker"&gt;Kevin Smoker&lt;/a&gt; - Project Manager at &lt;a href="http://www.lifetechnologies.com/"&gt;Life Technologies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And about the tax benefits of making certain purchases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Businesses are incentived to spend year end budgets because these purchases are at a &amp;lsquo;pre-tax&amp;rsquo; discount of up to 39%.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/michaelsacca"&gt;Michael Sacca&lt;/a&gt; - Co-Founder of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TinyFactorySD"&gt;Tiny Factory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Implementing Annual Discounts in Our Product&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how we approached this with &lt;a href="http://www.hookfeed.com"&gt;HookFeed&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We modified our homepage design before launch, in order to push the annual plan harder than previously planned. After a few iterations, we decided the following aspects were important:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promotion text in the pricing section speaking directly to any visitors who may be looking to spend their remaining budgets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make it clear that the promotion is only available through the end of the year — adding some urgency (we’re offering 3 months free versus the regular 2 months free when paying annually).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decided to still default to monthly prices so as not to give sticker shock to those who want to choose monthly billing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added a checkbox saying &amp;ldquo;I want three months free&amp;rdquo; which toggles the price to the annual plan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hookfeed.com"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is what we ended up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="HookFeed's Approach to Annual Pricing Discounts #1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/HookFeed/hookfeed-annual-pricing-header.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="HookFeed's Approach to Annual Pricing Discounts #2" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/HookFeed/hookfeed-annual-pricing.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an early-stage, bootstrapped SaaS, cash flow is a top priority. If you’re in a similar boat, it should be your priority as well. It is the one metric that decides whether we’ll still be working on our products in X months and not looking for jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I can combine a small tweak with good timing to yield a cash-flow surge, you bet your ass I’m gonna try!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
