# Your Lack of Goals is Killing Your Product

We started building HookFeed several months ago, and although we’ve seen great results and it’s been one of the most exciting yada yada. We realized we were doing it all wrong.

## Surprise vs. Intent

When you’re working daily on your product, great things are bound to happen. And when they do, they’ll make you feel incredible.

> This feeling is so powerful because it drives momentum, and helps keep you energized about your app.

But without pre-planning and intention, these results can be more harmful than good. They can make you drunk on imaginary/meaningless wins and shift your focus away from what actually matters: revenue and profitability.

Go on to talk about goals, etc.

Close saying how HookFeed is completely different and launching in the coming weeks.
